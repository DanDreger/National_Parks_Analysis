====== Popular Parks

#####An analysis of why certain national parks are more popular than others 

You might be surprised to know that not all national parks are created equal. There are wild differences in size, seasonal access, activities offered, wildlife, and weather. But one of the greatest differences between the parks is the average number of visitors each year. 

In an effort to understand why some parks are more popular than others, we set out to answer the following questions:

*Does the average temperature during a park's peak season (May-Sept) affect it's anual visitors?
*Does being near major cities draw more visitors into a national park?
*Do older, more historical parks, enjoy more anual visitors?
*Do larger national parks attract more overnight stays?

##### Some Caveats
The national park system is comprised of almost 500 sites across all 50 states and teritories. Battle grounds, monuments, nature preserves, etc are all *managed* by the US National Park system, but are NOT national parks. For this research, we included ONLY sites with the  **National Park** designation. There are 63 of them in total
