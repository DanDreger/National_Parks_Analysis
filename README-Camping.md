## Camping and Park Size Analysis 
* The analysis explored the relationship between park size and overnight stays in national parks. However, it found some connection, with a correlation coefficient of 0.02, a very small correlation.
Additionally, a statistical test comparing park size and overnight stays showed a significant difference. This suggests that other factors like amenities, attractions, location, and accessibility may have a greater impact on the number of overnight stays.
In conclusion, while larger parks may have the potential to attract more overnight visitors, the relationship between park size and overnight stays is weak. It's important to consider other influential factors when aiming to attract visitors to stay overnight in national parks.
